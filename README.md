## Overview

[FRC Scouting](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.team6378.thanu.frcmanager) is an Android app that allowed teams to scout opponents, create strategies against key teams and rank teams for alliance selection for the 2018 FIRST Robotics Competition: FIRST Power Up. The app on the Google Play Store will always remain in Alpha because our team vowed we would completely release the app once we made it to Worlds but sadly, we did not. Thus, it will always remain in Alpha.

## Technologies Used
